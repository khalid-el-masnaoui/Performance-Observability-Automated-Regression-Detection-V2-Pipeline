# Performance Observability & Automated Regression Detection V2 Pipeline

A containerized end-to-end (almost :upside_down_face:) **performance observability and automated regression detection system** for PHP applications.

This project integrates:

- ⚡ Nginx + PHP-FPM application layer
- 📊 Prometheus metrics collection
- 📈 Grafana dashboards
- 🔥 SPX PHP profiler with flamegraphs
- 🚨 Alertmanager for alert routing
- 🤖 Custom Automated regression detection service (:snake: Python) 
- 🧪 k6 load testing for automated performance validation
- 📄 PDF report generation for baselines & regressions (:snake: Python)

This project is intended as a practical demo of how to wire **PHP request metrics**, **alerting**,  **dynamic profiler activation**,  **automatic regression detection** and **historical trend analysis & tracking** together into a reproducible Docker-based performance observability & automated regression detection pipeline.

## Overview

This project is designed to detect performance regressions automatically by:

1. collecting request latency metrics from PHP routes,
2. comparing current performance against stored baselines,
3. triggering SPX profiling when a route slows down,
4. sending Slack alerts if configured,
5. generating PDF regression reports,
6. surfacing flamegraphs and metrics for root cause analysis.
7. Automated generation of baseline and regression reports, historical trend analysis & tracking


## Architecture

The stack is designed to demonstrate a simple full pipeline:
